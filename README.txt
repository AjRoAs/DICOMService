The DICOM project.

Quick Start Guide

    You must have Java version 6 or better to run.

    Put your PACS information in the <PACSList> in the dicomsvcConfig.xml file
    
    Add the following entries to your PACS with the host where you will be
    running this program:
    
        AE Title       Port
        -------------  ----
        DICOMSVC-5681  5681
        DICOMSVC-5682  5682
        DICOMSVC-5683  5683
        DICOMSVC-5684  5684
    
    
    cd to the directory containing the unpacked files and run this program from the command line:
        
        rundicomsvc.bat  (Windows)
    
        rundicomsvc.sh   (Linux)
    
    Use a browser to visit:
    
        https://localhost:8091/
    
    Skip past the scary warning that tells you that the certificate is not trusted.
    
    
    
 To build:
    

  Use 'mvn assembly:assembly' from the command line to build everything.
  
  From Eclipse you can use:
  
      right click on pom.xml
      
      click Run As ...
      
      click Maven assembly:assembly
    
This will generate all of the required resources including the jar file with
all dependencies and the RPM file for Linux installation.  The generated files
are put in the target directory.

To install the client, put the files:

    dicomsvc-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar
    DICOMUpload.bat

into the desired directory and run the bat file.

The product version is driven by the <version> tag in the pom.xml file.
The server and client share the same version.  As a developer, if you make
changes to the code that warrant a version change, then change this
value before building a new package.




The following is an example of how to build a keystore file using Unix shell commands.  Change the OU (organizational
unit) and O (organization) to suit your site.  This may also be done on Windows, but you must
translate the ${...} shell-isms to the Windows equivalent.  
    
    pw=[PASSWORD]
    host=[myhost]

    keytool -genkey -v -alias dicomsvc_${host} -dname "CN=${host}, OU=Radiation Oncology, O=University of Michigan, C=US" -keypass ${pw} -keystore dicomsvc_${host}.jks -storepass ${pw} -keyalg "RSA" -sigalg "SHA512withRSA" -keysize 2048 -validity 36500
    keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore dicomsvc_${host}.jks -destkeystore dicomsvc.jks -srcstoretype JKS -deststoretype JKS -srcstorepass ${pw} -deststorepass ${pw} 
    
The dicomsvc.jks keystore contains all of the possible certificates that a client might want to use.
This file should be copied to client projects, such as DICOMClient.

The individual key stores named with their IP are for the different hosts where the server might be run.

Note: The password must be the same in both instances on the above keytool invocation.

The key_password is required by the server and is stored in the dicomsvcConfig.xml file.  For
this reason it is important that the this file be readable only by the service itself.

To list the file

    keytool -list -v -keystore dicomsvc.jks -storepass [password]




When accessing the service using a web browser, a warning is shown indicating that it is untrusted.
IE will say: 'There is a problem with this website's security certificate.'  Click the 'Continue to this website (not recommended).' to continue.
If you do not want the warning, do the following to permanently trust the web site:

    How to make IE8 trust a self-signed certificate in 20 irritating steps

      1 Browse to the site whose certificate you want to trust.
      2 When told "There is a problem with this website's security certificate.", choose "Continue to this website (not recommended)."
      3 Select Tools->Internet Options.
      4 Select Security->Trusted sites->Sites.
      5 Confirm the URL matches, and click "Add" then "Close".
      6 Close the "Internet Options" dialog box with either "OK" or "Cancel".
      7 Refresh the current page.
      8 When told "There is a problem with this website's security certificate.", choose "Continue to this website (not recommended)."
      9 Click on "Certificate Error" at the right of the address bar and select "View certificates".
     10 Click on "Install Certificate...", then in the wizard, click "Next".
     11 On the next page select "Place all certificates in the following store".
     12 Click "Browse", select "Trusted Root Certification Authorities", and click "OK".
     13 Back in the wizard, click "Next", then "Finish".
     14 If you get a "Security Warning" message box, click "Yes".
     15 Dismiss the message box with "OK".
     16 Select Tools->Internet Options.
     17 Select Security->Trusted sites->Sites.
     18 Select the URL you just added, click "Remove", then "Close".
     19 Now shut down all running instances of IE, and start up IE again.
     20 The site's certificate should now be trusted.

Chrome is no better, Firefox is really easy.




Files of interest:

src/main/resources/log4j.properties
    log4j properties file
    
src/main/resources/Install
    directory contains the installation files used to generate the
    RPM file for Linux installation.  Within that directory: 
    
    dicomsvc : shell script installed into /etc/rc.d/init.d and implements the start / stop / restart / status commands

    description : Description that shows up in the RPM via rpmquery --info dicomsvc

    common : defines common values for the other scripts.  It is inserted in them by the BuildRpm program.
    
    post : shell script that is run by the rpm installer after copying files (%post part of specfile)
    
    postun : shell script run by the rpm installer after un-installation (after removing files) (%postun part of specfile)
    
    pre : shell script run by the rpm installer before copying files (%pre part of specfile)
    
    preun : shell script run by the rpm installer before un-installation (before removing files) (%preun part of specfile)
    
    
src/main/resources/DICOMUploadHelp.html
    Contains the Dicom Client help text that is edited and then put into the edu.umro.dicom.client.Help class.
    This class also contains a main method that formats this text for cutting and pasting into the Help.java file.


The Linux service supports the start, stop, restart, and status operations
with the /etc/init.d/dicomsvc script:

    dicomsvc start
    dicomsvc stop
    dicomsvc restart
    dicomsvc status

To install on Linux (as root):

    rpm --install dicomsvc-0.0.1-1.noarch.rpm

To un-install on Linux (as root) use the command below.  Note that this
will remove configuration files.

    sudo rpm -e dicomsvc

To check to see if the RPM is installed on Linux:

    rpmquery dicomsvc

To extract all files and spec file from the RPM file on Linux:

    rpm2cpio DICOMService-0.0.1-1.noarch.rpm | cpio  -idmv

    rpm --scripts -qp DICOMService-0.0.1-1.noarch.rpm > spec

The main files are installed in:

    /usr/local/dicomsvc

Log files are put in:

    /var/log/dicomsvc
    



For anonymizing files, study IDs (and probably series IDs) should be modified consistently
    in order to be accepted by software that expects them to be so.  By 'consistent', we mean
    that cross-references between series should still be operable, even though they have changed.

    In an earlier version of the software, a series was imported to a PACS (ConQuest), and then
    a copy of the series was anonymized.  The anonymized series was uploaded (pushed) to the PACS,
    but it failed because the PatientID had changed but the StudyInstanceUID was still the same, which
    meant that the StudyInstanceUID was being used for more than one patient, so that PACS rejected
    it.  The message in the log file was (reformatted for clarity): 

    ***Refused to enter inconsistent link PatientID into DICOMStudies:
        PatientID = '11112345'
        StudyInsta = '1.2.826.0.1.3680043.2.135.733423.48611003.7.1325114853.44.83',
        Old='99999999',
        Refused='11112345'
