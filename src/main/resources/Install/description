The DICOM standard (http://medical.nema.org/) defines its
own network protocol, storage format, and security system,
which drives users of that data to use specialized tools to
access it.  This service instead provides an interface using
domain independent standards such as HTTP, XML, JPEG, and
SSL to simplify DICOM access.  Specifically, the service
provides a ReST interface that allows clients to find, read,
construct, and convert DICOM files, and provides access to
PACSs (Picture Archiving and Communication System).  Browser
access to this data is also supported.
